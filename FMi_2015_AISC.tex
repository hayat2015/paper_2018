\begin{abstract}
Cloud computing provides scientists with a large number of powerful resources.
%
These resources enhance the productivity of the whole system.
%
Running complex scientific workflows on Cloud resources rather then on-premise increases the performance of execution.
%
Nevertheless, traditional scientific workflow management (SWfM) systems are not yet adapted for the Cloud.
%
Creation of scientific workflows and their execution in the Cloud still face many challenges due to the complexity of the Cloud environment. 
%
Migrating a part or the whole scientific application to the Cloud is not trivial .
%
It should be based on a solid strategy.
%
Questions like: Where to store the data and where to execute the processes need to be investigated.
%
In this paper, we first present \RenewGrass{}, a tool for modeling and executing image processing workflows by \emph{reference nets}.
%
Then, we discuss the deployment of \RenewGrass{} into the Cloud.
%
This work includes also a use case example related to the remote sensing domain.
%
%Here we should emphasize the results provided in this paper.
